.SH DESCRIPTION
This suite of functions provides a
nonblocking alternative to
.IR qio (9).
Data is stored in a 
.B CasQueue 
structure as a sequence of variable sized
.BR Blocks;
see
.IR allocb (9).
.PP
The 
.B CasQueue
is a lightweight alternative to
.B Queue.
This interface is less featureful than
.IR qio (9),
but is non-blocking and 
potentially faster on multiprogrammed systems
with many readers or writers.
Get and put operations
utilize an atomic compare-and-swap primitive
to avoid locking, and the first block at the
head of the queue is kept as a dummy node; see
.IR atom (2)
and the paper linked below.
.PP
.I Casqopen
initializes and returns a pointer to a new
.B CasQueue,
with
.I limit
setting the queue limit (high water mark) in bytes. 
.PP
.I Casqget
dequeues and returns the first (non-dummy)
.B Block
on 
.I q.
If 
.I q
is empty, it returns a null pointer.
If 
.I q
is closed, it raises the
.IR error (9)
.B Ehungup.
.PP
.I Casqput
enqueues 
.I b 
to the end of
.I q
and returns the number of bytes written if successful.
If
.I q
is full, it returns -1; if closed,
.B Ehungup
is raised.
.PP
.I Casqsize 
returns the total number of bytes
allocated to the blocks in
.I q,
accurate within one block.
.PP
.I Casqclose
marks
.I q
closed. Subsequent attempts to read or write will raise an
.IR error (9).
Blocks are not freed as in
.IR qio (9)'s
qclose,
because read or write operations may still be finishing
after the queue is closed.
.I Casqfree
may be called
after readers and writers have finished.
.PP
.I Casqfree
Frees any queued blocks
(including the dummy) and then frees
.I q
itself. Should only be called once 
.I q
is safely closed
and no processes are still writing to or reading from
.I q.
.PP
.I Casqsetlimit
resets the high water mark of the 
.I q
to
.I limit.
