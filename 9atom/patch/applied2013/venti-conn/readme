Subject venti-conn(2)

Change to the man page to note that vtdial checks the
environment and falls back to tcp!$venti!venti. Also
submitted as a patch to sources.

Discovered while poking at venti today, in service of
my other issues. I wasn't at home and didn't want to
try a new kernel remotely. I'm home now and will give
it a shot shortly.
