If you run this:
	{for (i in `{seq 1 70000}) echo '½•α·'} | mc | wc
mc will eventually suicide. The error comes from
/sys/src/libdraw/font.c:/^agefont which assumes it has a
display. Normally, this is set up by geninitdraw (usually
via initdraw), but mc.c avoids that to avoid the screen
redraws (flicker, at a minimum, but worse in long-running
cases). 

graphics(2) does not prohibit this use, so I made the least
intrusive change to make it work.
