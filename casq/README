Lock-Free Concurrent Queue Algorithm
Dan Defossez, Caleb Malchik, and Emmett Moore

The interface is described in casq.9 and the code is discussed in a big comment
at the top of casq.c. I'll just describe here what each file is.

casq.c - code for casq interface
casq.9 - man page
?p?c - tests with 1 or 2 consumers or producers. can be used to measure
  userspace performance if you comment out the print statements and
  increase NENTS.
{dat,error,fns,mem,portdat,portfns}.h, lib/ - from kernel, modified for userspace
stuff.h - some extra kernel things, and struct/fn definitions that would be in
  portdat/portfns in the kernel
stuff.c - reimplementations of some kernel functions for userspace. messy.
