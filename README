Kernel Sanders
Improving concurrent queues for Plan 9/9atom, Tufts CS Senior Capstone Project

Directories:
9 - source code for the Plan 9 kernel
hello - hello world program
three-inch - attempt to isolate qio.c to run in Plan 9 user space

Instructions for compiling/running our code on our rpi:
- clone our repo, say it is at /path/to/repo on your computer
- get drawterm - http://swtch.com/drawterm/
- drawterm -u <username> -c <ip address> (we'll send you the info)
- type in password
- the screen should go gray
- right click and click "new", click & drag to get a terminal!
- cd into /mnt/term/path/to/repo
  (notice your entire filesystem is accessible at /mnt/term)
- in the three-inch directory, type mk to compile, ./qio to run
  (mkfile defines the rules for compiling & linking the executable)
